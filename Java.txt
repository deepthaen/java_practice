Class -->
    Its template from which we create object, which has group of objects.
   why - we use class to store varaibles,objects, methods
   where -- we use in any kind of project , under any package com.pack
   what -- we write methods, constructors- we extend and create object, reflection

package -->
    package is a group of classes combined to gether and can be builded as library and import as single package

Different Packages Available in Java?
        java.lang

Object -->
    Which has data(value) and functionality.
    Object is blue print of class and object is base for jave package
    Object class is present in java.lang package
   why - We us to create variables or methods
   where - we use in class

Can u create a constructor ?

- Constructor is blue print of class, which will have name as class name, doesnot have return type, which executed when ever object is created.
- There different types of constructors: 1. default constructor, and parameterized constructor and non pamatermized constructor.
- Will declare funstionality in c0onstructor of parent class and we will use in child by creating object of parent class.

what is super ?
    - Super refers to parent class, its keyword, used in constructor

what is this?
    - is keyword, refers to current class.

Note :: To Be discussed
1. COnstructor

What is interface ?
    -- INterface is kind of a class
        class - public class name{}
        interface- public interface name{};
    -- when we dono what to implement, then i create interface
        and define functionality
        Example ::
            i wan to buy a audi car

            FUnctionality ::
                car(String model);
                Engine(String type);
            Implementation ::
                public void car(String model){
                    model = Audi A6;
                }
    -- we can achieve 100% abstraction in interface
    -- we can write without body


What is Abstraction ?
   Hide implemtation and shoe functionality



Questions ::
    1. Create String buffer,string builder and use some methods and list all methods available - yet to discuss
    2. Calculate sum of array - done
    3. write a code swap 2 numbers  - done
    4. Write a code replace all and print only alphabets (input :: sdfghj1234567@#$%^asdfg) - done

Diff btw Abstract and interface?
    -- interface
        -- it is a mechanisam to declare methods, when we donon what has to be implementation
        -- we add interface keyword instead of class
        -- we can declare methods here and implement in different classes
        -- here we can achive 100% abstraction
        -- not manditorily we shud mention public
        -- the interface can be used in different class by using implements keyword
    -- abstract
        -- it is a kind of class, which we add in the place class name
             public abstract class name{}
        -- we can declare method and we can implement also
        -- here 100% abstraction is not possible
        -- we can access abstract class by using extends
        -- here when we want declare a method, we have to add abstract in method
            abstract void method():


When we go for interface?
    -- when we dono actual requirement, then to just declare what has to be done

When we go for Abstract?
    -- we go when we have partial requirement, where in i can declare and implement as well


abstract vs Abstraction ?
    abstract : computer science
     its kind of class, where we declare and implement methods
    abstraction :: concept (Flow chart)
        its a oops concept


oops ::
    Abstraction
    Polymorpyshm
    Encapsulation
    Inheritance
What is compile and run time error?

Questions ::
    Create interface and implemt in different class - done
    create 2 interface and implement in different class - done
    create interface and implment in one class and extend to different class and call methods in main method - done
    Create interface
        create retunable method   -- explain return concept
        create non retunable method
        create parametrised method(String name)  -- explain return concept
        check wether u can create constructor ? NO
    What is interface   ?
    - Interface is process where it will hide implemention and show function declaration
    - we can achive 100% Abstraction
    - we can have constructor in intrface
    - it will be  public final static and Abstract
    - Will not conatin concetre method


    Create abstract class and extend to other class - done
    Cretae 2 abstract class and try to extend both   ? - Not Possible
    Create abstract class and extend to other class and extend to other class and write in main method - done
    Create abstract class with only declaration - done
    Create abstract class with only implementation - done
    Create Abstract class with both declare and implementation - done

    what is abstract?
     - Abstract is kind of class which is access specififer
     - We go for Abstract when we does not have complete requirement clarification
     of application, let say we have req clarification some functionality and does
     not have req clarification on few other part of appli then we go for abstract
      - In Abstract class we can have method declaration and method implementation both
      - In abstract class if anyone method has just method declaration then have
      use abstract as keyword for method declaration and class
      - 100% abstraction is not possible

    Sum from 1to 100 numbers? - Dome
    i will give a character, print what ASCII value for it (Ex = A=60 a=97) - done

*** Doubt - when will be constructor called, when it be executed ?
    -- when a object is created, first constructor will be called
            What constructor will be having ?
                it will have which have assigned anything in current class
                    this.driver = driver;



OOPS ::

Abstraction ::
    what is abstraction?
        -- HIde Implementation and show functionality
    where we use Abstraction ?
        -- we use in Interface and abstract
        -- in interface we hide implementationa nd show functionality
            -- hide implementation -- when we click on method it will take to declaration


Inheritance ::
    what is inheritance ?
        -- accessing something from child class to super class
    How we inherit ?
        -- by using Extends and implements
    where we use ?
        -- We use when we want to inherit any class or an interface or abstract class
    super ?
        Accessing something from parent class or sub class


Question  ::
    Calucate sUM of 1 to 100 ?

    int a =1;
    int b=5;

    o/p = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15

    First appraoch :: I will use for loop and traverse from a to b and keep adding
    Second Approach :: using N naturals number, N*(N+1)/2

 TIme complexity::
  BEST case
  WORST case

Question ::
    Factotial of A number ?
    int a =5;
    o/p = 5*4*3*2*1 = 125

    first appraoch ::traverse till a number

    int a=0;
    int temp=1;
    for(int i=a;i>=1;i--){
        temp=temp*i;
    }
    Second Appraoch ::  recursion
    int a=5
        public int factorial(int a){
            return a*factorial(a-1);
        }

Sort Array ::

i/p :: [1,3,4,5,7,2]
o/p :: [1,2,3,4,5,7]
---> i will travese through complete array
     use two for loop nested for loop
     inner for loop i will compare each index value and if first is less then second value then will move to next index
     if first value is greater then second value then will move value ti temp variable and change positin

    1. First approach by sort fnction
     a.Array(sort)
   2.   Sceond Approch by using will travese through complate and use two for loop


Inheritance Example ::
    1. BasePage
        public static WebDriver laucnhBrowser(){
            driver = new ChromeDriver();
            return driver;
        }
    2. LoginPage extends BasePage
        public static void loginApp(WebDriver driver){
            driver.findelement.click();
        }

    3. Test extends LoginPage
        public static vois main(String[] arg){
            WebDriver driver = launchBrowser();
            loginApp(driver);
        }

   Example 2 ::
   1. BasePage
           public static WebDriver laucnhBrowser(){
               driver = new ChromeDriver();
               return driver;
           }
       2. LoginPage extends BasePage
           public static void loginApp(){
                driver=launchBrowser();
               driver.findelement.click();
           }

       3. Test extends LoginPage
           public static vois main(String[] arg){
               loginApp();
           }


Encapsulation ::
    Encap - collect form information
    Insulation - Set something or put something

    Tablet - some medicine, apply to body

    Def :: wrapping data and code  into a single unit

    1. Getter
    2. Setter
    3. Data hiding

    Example ::
        public class cse(){
            public String students;
            public String teacher;

            public void setStudents(String students){
                this.students =students;
            }
            public String getStudents(){
            return students;
            }

        }

        main(){
            Cse c = new Cse();
            c.setStudents("Deeptha");
           String stu =  c.getStusents();
        }

Polymorphysim ::
    poly -- many
    MOrpyshm - forms

    -- Over loading
    public void travel(String type)//bus,car
    public void travel(String type, int count)
    public void travel(String type, int count, String place)
    public void travel(String place, int count);
    public void travel(String type,long size)

    -- Over Riding
        Lane 1  - vehicle(String model)
        Lane 2  - vehicle(String model)
        Lane 3  - vehicle(String model)


    over loading ::
        Performaing same action with different parameters
        writing same method names with different parameters
      why::
        BCZ when we have same fucntional with different usability
            A car can used in different ways
    Over Riding ::
        Having same method name in different class(Example interface declaration)
        in interface we decalre and overide any many classes as u require.

    Run time polymorphysim ::
        overRiding
        While executing u will face an error if any issues in coiding

    Compiletime polymorpyshm ::
        Over loading

1. Why String is immutable?
 because String objects are cached in String pool. Since cached String literals are shared between multiple clients there is always a risk,
 String - is a class and not premitive
 Immutable -- Which cannot be changed
 String s ="HD";




 2. diff btw interface, class and abstract class

      Interface - Its mechanisum, where just show method declaration, we use interface to on declarcation, we wite implention
      in its implemeted class, use implements keyword, we can achive 100% abstaction
      Abstract - its kind of class, which has implemention and declaration both, will write implemention in sub class by extending it,
             100% abstraction is not possible
      Class - its template or bluprint, which has group object, which has method, statis block, instace block, variable constructor, no just method declaratio n


  3. create pojo for ur class details - name, age, rollnum, and set and get values

   4. [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -- iterate using for each loop and sum all numbers


Try Catch Finally ::

Every try block should be immediately followed either by a catch block or finally block.
code which is prone to exceptions is placed in the try block
exception occurs, that exception occurred is handled by catch block
Try{
Statement - code
}
Catch (exeption){
Statement - catch execption
}
Finally {
Statement --  // The finally block always executes.

}
Finally ::

finally block of code always executes, irrespective of occurrence of an Exception.

  ***** Lazy Initialsation, Early initialisation

What design pattern u r using Automation Framework?

    -- SingleTon patternn
    -- Page Object or factory pattern
    -- Builder pattern
    -- abstract pattern


Final, Finally, Finalise ::

    Final ::
        public final String PROJECT = "SOM";
        it is used for making consatnts variabels

    Finally  ::
        used in Try catch block
        Even exception is caught or not finally block will be executed

    Finalise::
        public static void method(){
        Classs a = new Class();
            Starts
            executes
            ends
            a.quit();
            // by default java will throw in garbage , it removes from stack or heap memory
        }


Heap will run in queue system, one after other objects -
    it will store in KVM , in order
    A a = new A();
    B b= new B();

 Static Array ::
 Single dimenstional Array
    int[] a ={1,2,3,4};
    or
    int[] a =new int[2];
    a[0]=1;
    a[1]=2;
    a[2]=5// this will throw array out of bound exception

 Two dimensinal Array ::
    int[][] a =[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] ;
    int[][] a =new int[row][cow];

Dynamic array ::
    ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
    arr.add(1);
    arr.add(1);
    arr.add(1);
    arr.add(1);
    arr.add(1);

List and ArrayList ?
    List :: it is interface
            it is collection of java
            it has all functions which are present in Arraylist
                Interface  i= new interfaceImplClass();
                List i = new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList ::
            it is a class
            it has predefind methods -- add,remove,size
            it implements List
            it is part of collection framework


Solve problem array ::

        int[] arr = [1,2,3,4,5]; =15
        [1,3,6,10,15]
        we need to sum

        for(int i=0;i<arr.size-1;i++){
            arr[i]=arr[i]+arr[i+1];
        }

        int[] prefix = new int[arr.length]
        prefix[0]=arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<arr.length;i++){
            prefix[0]
        }

Sort an array ::
    int[] arr = {1,3,5,4,2};
    o/p =1,2,3,4,5

Future Trend ==>


Collections ::

    List ::
        -- when we have a group of people arrnageing them in a sequence
        -- u have 60 members of students
            ["hari","Deeptha","ram","Lolakshi"]
        -- A group of Objects, strings, integers
         its called collections
         -- we will store elements dyanamically on run time
        -- List is a interface
            it has predefined method
                get
                size
                add
        List<String>
        List<int>
        List<Object>

    ArrayList ::
        Array -- it is collection of static and dynamic array
        List     -- its a interfacea dn collections of object and storing in a sequence

        Arraylist -- its class

        Arraylist implement List

        ArrayList<String>
        ArrayList<Int>

     2 ways ::
        ArrayList<String  array = new ArrayList<><();
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

 List<WebElement> listofSHipments = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//div[text()='Shipment ID']/../../../../div[2]/div"));
        for (int i = 0; i < listofSHipments.size(); i++) {
           String Shipment = driver.finelement(by.xpath("//div[text()='Shipment ID']/../../../../div[2]/div["+i+"]/div/div[2]"))
        }

Map ::
     -- Map is concept of collections
     -- it is a interface
     -- it has pre defined methods decalred in interface
     -- it can store values in KEY and value pair
     syntax :: [Key :: value]
     name = deeptha
     UAT= 124
     SIT= 456
     url =ajio.com
     somurl =som.ajio.com
     dburl=12345678

     map.get(somurl)
     map.put(somurl,"som.ajio.com")

        -- duplicates are not allowed
        -- duplicates are overided with latest value
 HashMaps::

    MAP Interface
    HASH - small maps
        url =
        dburl =


When we go for list/Arraylist and Map/HashMap

List/Arraylist ==
        when we want to iterate based on index
        and want to store in index based
        [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
        add()
        get();
Map/HashMap ===
        when we have key and value pair
        get(key)
        put(key,value)
        key:value
        url=ajio.com
        mobilenumber=9876543

Linked List and Stack

LInked -->
    connection btw 2 objects or nodes or elemnts or persons
    LInked --> List
    List = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
        index - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6
    Flight -
        Bangalore to Mysore
        [Bangalore,ramnagar ,Maddur,Mandya,Srirangapatna,Mysore ] 0 and N
    Bus -
        Banaglore to mysore
    Bangalore - ramnagar -Maddur - Mandya -Srirangapatna -Mysore

    List<String> ll = new LinkedList<>();

    Head - [1]-[1]-[3]-[4]-[5] -Tail _ NULL


    Node head;
    Node next;
    int data;

        Head-next[data]


Binary Search ::
        it s a linear Data structure
        it shud contain always sorted order

        start, mid and end
        start = 0;
        end =arr.length-1;
        mid =start+end/2


    Question :: Find 8 in array, using binary search
           int[] arr= [1,3,5,6,8,9,11];
           int k=8;

        1. store start =0;
        2. store end = arr.length-1;
        3. mid = start+end/2;
        4. Now traverse till start<= end ==> 0<=7
            1. now check arr[mid]<k // 6<9
                start =mid+1;
            2. else
                end= mid-1;
             if(arr[mid]==k) return mid;



 Linear Data structure ::
        -- any data which can be readed sequencely


Stack ::
    -- Stack is a linear data structure
    -- It is LIFO (Last in First out)
    -- push - to add data
    -- pop - to delete
    -- peek - to get current value
    -- top -- to print top of value

    top - top most value in stack

    1. Can u design a stack using int array
    2. can u design a stack using linkedlist
    int[] arr ={1,4,5,6,8,9};

    9
    8
    6
    5
    4
    1

    int top;

    Stack(){
        top=-1;
    }

    push(int data){
        arr[++top]=data; //10
    }

    pop(){
        if(top>=0){
            arr[top--]
        }
    }

    peek(){
    if(top>=0){
        int val = arr[top];
        sout(val);
    }
    }

      boolean isEmpty(){
        if(top==-1) true;
      }
    printAll(){
        for(int i=top;i>-1;i--){
            sout(arr[i])
        }
    }

    main(){
    Stack s = new Stack();
        s.push(10);
        s.push(15);
        s.push(10);
    }

Stack - it has order and sequence
linkedlist - it has order and sequence
Linear

Set ::
    -- Set is extended from Collection frmaework
    -- it doesn't have any order or any sequence
    -- it reads randamly
    -- it doesnt allows duplicates
    -- it is a interface

    Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
    add()
    AddAll()
    ReatinAll()
    clear
    size

When we go foir set
    WindowHandles in selenium
    Set<> windows = driver.getWindowHandles();
    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
            Set<String> windows = driver.getWindowHandles();
            Iterator<String> iterat = windows.iterator();
            while(iterat.hasNext()){
                String window = iterat.next();
            }

    -- when ever u dont require in order
    -- fetch randomly


HashMap<Key,Value> --> key value pair  -- Property Files,
ArrayList<String> -- when we want to store in aindex based
Linkedlist<String> - when we want to store in link based
Stack<String> - we go when we want to remove,add, get LIFO - Order detail page
Set<String> - we go whenwe dont need to store in order, and datta should be uniqic
             - used in whislist screen


Queue ::
    -- is a linear data structure
    -- it has order and sequence
    -- FIFO[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    - front, rear
    - Enqueue(Ad) , Deque(Remove)
    -- u can only deque from front side, bcz of FIFO policy
    -- Eneque can be donr only At last(rear)
    -- Priority queue
    -- LinkedlIst

    Enqueue
    Dequeue
    Front
    rear
    size;
    int[] arr = new int[1000];
    int capacity;

    Queue(int size){
        this.size=size;
        front=0;
        rear=0;
        capacity =size;
    }

    public void enqueue(int data){
        rear = rear%capacity; // 2%5 = 2
        arr[rear]=data;
        rear++;
    }

linked list, Heap, Tree, Matrix, Graph
//List, linkedlist, hashmap, set, binary search, stack, queue
// LinkedList, stack using linkedlist,
// Queue - Priority queue and  queue using Linklist
// seaarch element in stack - and Size


implemation ::
    linkedlist -- add, get, delete
    Stack -- lIFO (push, pop, peek)
    Queue -- FIFO(enqueue, deeque)
